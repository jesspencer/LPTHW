## Diary to Completing the book

February 26, 2019

1. Created Git repository for LPTHW.

2. Took inventory of files already done but untracked.

3. Decided to restart book instead of uploading all of the files.
Currently on Ex28.py, so restarting will be beneficial and speedy.

3. Started timer on togler; goal is to complete first 5 exercises.
