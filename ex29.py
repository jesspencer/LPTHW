'''Study Drills
1. what do you thik the if does to the code under itself.
Ans: I think that the if makes the code under it conditional
The same as making conditional formating in excel or world
So 'if' true 'then' perform the code

2. Why does the code under the if neeed to be indented four spaces?
Ans: The code under the if statement needs to be indented because python cares about spacing
in order to made the code functional it must be indented

3. What happends if it isn't indented?
Ans: If it isn't indented the code will not be functional

4. Can you put other boolean expressions from Ex 27 in the if statements? Try it
ans: Yes; I put the expressions from ex27 into lines 5-15

5. What happens if you change the inital variables for people, cats, and dogs?
Ans: Changing the inital variabless for people, cats, and dogs would
change the names, so I would need to update the names in the if statements if I changed the variables
